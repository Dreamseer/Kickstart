# Kickstart

This is my **Kickstart** library, now rewritten from scratch with a new file
structure and awesome stuff like Stylus, jQuery, Normalize, Grunt,
some PHP includes, basic search engine optimizations and some inspirations from
HTML5 Boilerplate.

## Initialization

	make

Installs NPM dependencies listed in `package.json` and runs Gruntâ€™s
default task afterwards which is:

	grunt

Default task which does the following sub-tasks:

 - create CSS files from [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/)
   sources
 - concatenate and minify generated CSS files
 - lint generated JS files
 - concatenate and minify generated JS files

## Cleanup generated stuff

To get rid of all generated JS and CSS files and to remove all local NPM
modules, run the following command:

	make clean

## To do

 - get rid of the Makefile, just use `npm install` and `grunt`
 - create proper `watch` and `clean` tasks for Grunt
